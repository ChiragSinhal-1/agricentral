# Description: 

A Google Firestore based enhanced agricultural supply chain and data transparency system for the efficient use of farm resources post harvest across the country.

# Problem Statement: 

We have often seen farmers struggling with multiple problems like finding good quality seeds as it is a critical and basic input for attaining higher crop yields and sustained growth in agricultural production. Distribution of assured quality seed is as critical as the production of such seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers, especially small and marginal farmers mainly because of exorbitant prices of better seeds. Another problem could be Agricultural Marketing, as this still continues to be in a bad shape in rural India. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price. In most cases, these farmers are forced, under socio-economic conditions, to carry on distress sale of their produce. In most small villages, the farmers sell their produce to the money lender from whom they usually borrow money. According to an estimate 85% of wheat and 75% of oil seeds in Uttar Pradesh, 90% of Jute in West Bengal, 70% of oilseeds and 35% of cotton in Punjab is sold by farmers in the village itself. Such a situation arises due to the inability of the poor farmers to wait for long after harvesting their crops. In order to meet his commitments and pay his debt, the poor farmer is forced to sell the produce at whatever price is offered to him. Additionally, the in-efficient supply chain gives rise to the huge amount of discarded crops.

## To summarise, the problems are:

1. Mismanaged supply chain.
2. There is no centralised directory where all the records of the farmers can be accessed based on the particular region and demographics.
3. The post-harvest losses reduce the farmer’s income, food security and livelihoods.
4. The agricultural operations are not modernised for large scale production and the quality of farm produce is not improved.
5. Sometimes farmers don't get fair value for their produce.
6. This disrupts the economy of the nation.

# Objective: 

The objective of the proposed engineered solution is to build a secure, tamper proof, automated centralised Agri platform providing a user with an intuitive and hassle free experience while navigating through the Agri resources. The solution acts as a one stop platform for availing all information on the Agricultural resources like seeds, best cultivation practices and agri reports to mention the few. The tamper proof solution will aim to provide a seamless exchange of individual Agriculture records with third parties like insurance companies, banking institutions etc. as well. All the features together will create a system and a channel which could make a difference and protect and enhance the lifecycle of the crops. Also the users will have a support option where they can raise a query and can get the answer from the experts. The solution will aim in enhancing the supply chain by making the process tamper proof and visible to parties at all times during the transaction.

## Methodology (Solution): 
1. All the agri records of an individual will be maintained in a secure database integrated with the cloud service in the front.
2. All the agri records stored will be tamper proof, only the right personnel will be able to make the modification into the same.
3. The solution comes integrated with the AI based bots for providing an ease to the user in finding the agri resource information around like the seeds, fertilisers etc.
4. The solution also comes with a provision to integrate the third parties, like transport companies, insurance to name the few. Any institution with the requirement of the agri records of an individual can take the data from the cloud service. The right to share the data with the third party lies in the hands of the user at all times. This process will eliminate the requirement to verify and authenticate the agri records enhancing the speed and the efficiency of the other entire Agricultural system.
5. The solution will provide a transparent tracking system of the grains during the commute. It will tabulate and capture the quality aspect of the grains as well. The record of each resources will be tamper proof and maintained in the central database.
6. The document scanner feature in the application will help the farmers and transporters automate the process of feeding the data into the database reducing delay and provide ease to each individual.
7. The notification integration with the application will keep the farmers updated will all the news and status regarding the orders placed by them.
8. Introduced the “Agricoin” concept as a reward for farmers to avoid following any different or non official channel for buying and selling crops.
